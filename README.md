The project involved working with a dataset of 1,465 rows and 16 columns, containing information on product details, customer engagement, and reviews.

## Project Topic: Amazon Project Review Analysis

### Project Overview
This project aims to analyze product and review data to identify trends and patterns, provide insights on product categories, ratings, discounts, and customer engagement and reate an Excel dashboard to visualize key findings and metrics.

### Data Source
The primary source data used is Amazon case study.xlsx downloaded from LMS data profile.

### Tools Used
The project utilized Microsoft excel to analyze data by creating pivot tables and dashboard. 

### Key Data Analysis Tasks
The project involved performing various analysis tasks, including:
- Calculating average discount percentages and ratings by product category.
- Identifying top-performing products and categories.
- Analyzing the relationship between ratings and discounts.
- Visualizing product distribution by price range and rating.

### Key Findings

1. Average Discount Percentage by Category

Some categories, such as Home improvement, Health and personal care, Computers & Accessories and Electronics, offer significantly higher average discounts (often exceeding 50%).
Musical Instruments, Car & Motorbike and Home & Kitchen offer 40-46% average discount.
Office Products show relatively lower average discounts (<20%).

2. Product Count by Category

Computers & Accessories, Electronics and Home & Kitchen have the highest number of listed products.
Categories like Office Products, Car & Motorbikes and other categories have fewer products, indicating either low seller interest or specialization.

3. Total Number of Reviews per Category

Electronics and Computers & Accessories generate the highest total review counts, suggesting strong customer engagement.
Car & Motorbikes and Health & personal care categories have lower review volumes.

4. Top-Rated Products

A few products consistently receive ratings of 4.8 and above, often coupled with high review counts.
These are often premium or highly-reviewed items in Computer & Accessories.

5. Average Actual Price vs Discounted Price

Categories like Electronics show a large gap between actual and discounted prices, signaling aggressive discounting strategies.
Office Products, Toys & Games have relatively consistent pricing, with minimal variation.

6. Highest Number of Reviews

The top 5 most-reviewed products all have over 400,000 reviews, typically from Electronics categories.

7. Products with ≥50% Discounts

Over 751 products (51% of total) have discounts of 50% or more.
This is most prevalent in Computers & Accessories, indicating clearance or promotion strategies.

8. Product Ratings Distribution

Most products cluster around 4.1 to 5.0 ratings.
Few products are rated below 3.0, suggesting either poor-performing products are removed or heavily optimized.

9. Total Potential Revenue

Electronics and Home & Kitchen top the list for potential revenue based on actual price × review count.
This aligns with their high price points and high engagement.

10. Price Range Buckets

Majority of products fall in the 0-5000 range.
High-end products (>50000) are fewer but generate more revenue per unit.

11. Rating vs Discount Relationship

No strong correlation observed; however:
Moderate discounts (20–40%) tend to have higher average ratings.
Extremely high discounts (>70%) sometimes correlate with lower ratings—possibly clearance items or low-quality products.

12. Products with <1,000 Reviews

Over 60% of products have fewer than 1,000 reviews.
This indicates either new products or products with low customer engagement.

13. Categories with Highest Discounts

Electronics, Computers & Accessories and Home and Kitchen categories offer the largest average and maximum discounts.

14. Top 5 Products by Rating × Review Count

These products dominate both in terms of popularity and customer satisfaction.
They typically belong to the Electronics and Books categories.


### Recommendations

1. Focus on High-Performing Categories

Prioritize marketing and inventory for Electronics, Home & Kitchen, and Computers & Accessories, which show high engagement and revenue potential.

2. Revise Discount Strategy

For categories with low ratings despite high discounts, reassess product quality or brand reputation.
Avoid excessive discounting unless strategically justified (e.g., end-of-life products).

3. Improve Visibility of Low-Review Products

Invest in promoting and incentivizing reviews for products with <1,000 reviews.
Use strategies like email follow-ups, discounts for feedback, and bundling.

4. Target Pricing Sweet Spots

Focus product offerings in the 0-5000 range, which has the highest product density.
Use psychological pricing (e.g. 5999) to optimize sales in this range.

5. Enhance High Potential Products

Identify products with high ratings but low review counts — these could be rising stars.
Boost these via marketing campaigns, sponsored listings, and influencer reviews.

6. Use Ratings to Drive Engagement

Promote products with ratings >4.5 as "Top Rated" in listings and ads to increase trust and conversions.

7. Optimize Categories with Low Engagement
For underperforming categories, either:
Improve product descriptions, images, and SEO, or consider exiting the category if ROI is consistently poor.
